# Weighted_Monuments

The Weighted Degree is the number of connections (edges) leading to or out of a settlement (node), weighted by the value allotted to each edge. For the purposes of my study of the Iberian Peninsula I turned to the work of Carreras and De Soto (2010), a connection based on a secondary road will be assigned a weight of 1 point; a major road a weight of 2; an upriver connection a weight of 1; a downriver connection a weight of 3; and a coastal connection a weight of 4.
