# Urban Network

The [interactive graph]() shows the urban network of the Iberian peninsula from a very simple approach: all places 45 km apart are connected. 

The idea of this graph originates from my doctoral thesis, published 2021, where I stated that the urban network of the Iberian Peninsula could not have relied solely on the urban, or self-governing, communities. To obtain a fully functioning network the Iberian Peninsula, and for that matter most regions of the Roman Empire, needed to rely on the secondary agglomerations supporting the network. This graph uses a maximum distance of 45 kilometers between two centres, or nodes. This is based on the idea of Bintliff (2002) stating that a maximum of 3 hours, or 15 kilometers, is to be expected for people to travel back and fort between settlements. I have extended this range in my work to 30 kilometrs, or 6 hours with the idea of two, maybe 3 das travel. However, creating a graph with this distance gives a very fragmented network.

The nodes are coloured after the status of the communities:

The fragmented nature of this graph, with a multitude of individual nodes led me to reconsider the maximum distance of 30 kilometers. As a result I opted for 45 kilometers, this then adds two full days of travel on the Bintliff idea. That is a visitor to another city would travel one full day of six hours and stay at a secondary agglomeration or mansio. The next day another 15 km, or 3 hours, travel allow to reach the city, finish what needs to be done and return to the resting place. The last 30 km are then left for the third day. This extended version of Bintliff's idea gives a representation that is closer to an urban network relying on secondary agglomerations.

However, this network does not include secondary agglomerations as this settlemnt type needs more research. Moreover, this network leaves out modes of transport. Using riverine or maritime routes some cities will be 'closer' to each other. In future work I will add these connections and improve the 45 km edges to differentiate for the road connections the represent.
